In this project, this was my first interaction with GODOT, and I utilized this as a way to learn more about the program and its capabilities, in which I tried to explore the most. As for the scene itself, I was inspired by scenes from the Mario games that I used to play on the WII, but designed it to be more of a park setting for personalization. In experimenting with GODOT, a follow-up question I have is how I can get other shapes other than a rectangle, and is there a way to play with shadowing?
